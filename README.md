  The player borns in an abandoned building where two kind of enemies live there, he starts with one power "White Ball",
  in this level he will find three powers (Lightning Ball, Ice Ball, Fire Ball),
  the Lightning Ball has medium damage and it damage all the enemies that are in a certain radius,
  the Ice Ball has low damage decrease the enemy's speed for a certain amount of time,
  the Fire Ball has high damage.
  To use the powers the user will need to use his mouse.
   
  
-Second Level is the Tunnel:
  In this level the player will face a bigger amount of enemies and a new kind of enemy.
  The player will find an Earthquake power which it has high damage, to use it the player will need to press on the HotKey "4".
  
  
-Third Level is the Freedom:
  In this level the player will need to kill all the enemies in the field, he will face the same three enemies that he faced in the
  previous two levels but they will have more health in this level and there will be three Giants each of them from different kind of enemy,
  each giant will drop a potion after they killed by the player that increases four times each power that the player has.
